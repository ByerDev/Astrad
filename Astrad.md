**A constructed conlang spoke by [my fursona](<My Fursona>). Also this is my first language, so it will probably not be good.**

This language is the combination of a few natural languages. These are:
- German: Phonology
- Latin: Grammar
- English: a <small>teensy</small> bit of grammar

This language uses a TON of prefixes and/or suffixes to eliminate irregularity. 
<small>Note: My primary language is German, so there may be some grammatical or vocabulary mistakes in this vault. Apologies in advance!</small>
